  In 2020, when the Covid 19 broke out, the rate of infections was low in the refugee settlement but that didn't stop me from thinking about a cheap solution to reduce  the spread of the virus. I researched about the transmission links and found out "contact" was the main factor for the covid 19 spreading in the refugee settlement hence I immediately thought about the schools with over 1700 students/ pupils in the refugee settlements that accesse water from the school taps and learned their is so much contact "opening the tap and again closing- at this stages we pick up the virus from the taphandle".

  I built my first prototype which takes much power then later build an arduino driven one with ultrasonic sensor , it works but can't help support the large number of the students due to the size of the container.

<p>
  This is the second prototype I made which has a large size container and rechargeable batteries attached. For this I recycled some plastic containers from the community to reduce the plastic disposal in the communities and then give out to a high school and a primary school within the refugee settlement, not for a covid 19 reason ,  but the current Ebola outbreak in Uganda which is increasing every day.
