  The Eco-star wooden power extension cable is an electrical power cable made out of wood material and its aimed at replacing the imported  power extension cables made out of plastic materials. It is made using local available resources (wood materials/timer) which are cost effective and It is aimed at reducing carbon emissions and landfill from plastic waste since they are environmental friendly than those made of plastic materials hence protecting the environment.

  The wood materials are collected from carpentry workshops. they are usually discarded as waste by carpenters. however, to us it is something usually. The component of electronic waste management is as well a subject here, for example, we remove components such as the LED light  from dead  or electronics that have reached end of life. This Innovation involves the practice of reuse and upcycling which promotes circularity of products resulting to reduction in waste and pollution hence creating a sustainable environment while creating economic profits.
